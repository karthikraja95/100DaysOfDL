# 100 Days of Deep Learning

- This repository is for my own personal use. 
- I am trying to write deep learning code everyday for the next 100 days from absolute newbie to expert level. 
- I also hope to create a repository with almost all the learning resources for anyone who wants to learn deep learning from scratch. 
- Planning to provide easy resources to learn from basic training neural networks to latest attention, transformers, self supervision, weak supervision based algorithms and architectures, etc
